## Plan: Tariffs Page Redesign

Goal: Redesign `/tariffs` page UI/structure to match LOCUS product logic (seekers vs landlords) without touching backend/API.

### Steps
- [x] Locate tariffs page, related components, and styles.
- [x] Review existing tariff data/IDs used in UI (ensure no API changes).
- [x] Draft new layout structure with user-type toggle and updated cards.
- [x] Implement UI changes (hero, toggle, card variants, mobile-first).
- [ ] Validate responsive behavior and basic interactions.

### Notes
- UI-only changes; preserve routing and pricing logic.
- Ensure primary plan visual emphasis and accessibility basics.
