# Plan tracking

- For any multi-step or cross-file task, keep a plan file updated in `.cursor/plans/`.
- If a relevant plan exists, update its statuses as work progresses.
- If no plan exists, create a new plan file and maintain it throughout the work.
- When a plan is mentioned by the user, treat it as the source of truth and align changes to it.
